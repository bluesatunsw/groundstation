# Hardware

## Setup
- Download the PlatformIO extension for VSCode (if on Windows, do this in WSL)
- Initialise a project in the hardware folder
    - Not totally sure how to do this, so needs more description
- If there are issues with includes (in particular Arduino.h), add 
  "/home/<username>/.platformio/packages/**" to your include path 
  (temporary fix/not sure this is the solution)
