# groundstation

Bluesat's autonomous, robotic groundstation project.

## Secrets

After cloning this repo, put all of your tokens inside of ``secrets.json``. You may rename ``example_secrets.json`` if you want a template. If you want to get our API keys message @omeh-a (Matt_#4292). Note that this file is ignored by git and you don't need to change anything to keep things secure.

## Git Hygiene guide

For this project we will be using standard software engineering principles for our version control.

### Branches

The most important of these is to **make sure to use a fresh branch for every new feature**.
In this case a "feature" is any atomic piece of work you might be contributing, i.e. small enough that you are the only one likely to be working on it. For example, if you are working in /hardware you might implement the module to translate celestial coordinates to motor positions as a feature.

In the case that you are working on a bigger part with another person (or people) you can make a branch with sub-branches for each feature.

### Code review and pull requests

**Never commit directly to main**. The only exception to this is for making administrative changes like editing the readme, .gitignore, .codeowners and so on.
Whenever you finish a feature on a branch like described above, you should submit a **pull request** to get it merged back into a parent branch. Pull requests are also known as "merge requests" on GitLab and some other services (far clearer name frankly) because they basically give you a chance to write up what you've done and documents all the changes you are going to make. It also lets you safely specify how you are going to handle any conflicts between your branch and the parent.

Once you have made your pull request you should ideally get somebody else who didn't contribute to do a **code review** for you. This is mostly important on larger features or things where a lot can go wrong. While this project doesn't have critical stakes or a deployment to risk, it's a very important habit and will often catch a lot of mistakes that are very hard to find on your own (especially when they are errors in design rather than in code).

## Programming style and toolchain

### Type/javascript and web

For all web-based languages, we will use ESLint on a relatively relaxed setting to catch typos and things that make code hard to read. If you use VSCode the ESLint extension will autofix these for you! For general style we will use StandardJS (which is what is used by pretty much everybody) - there is also a VSCode extension for this! For Javascript itself, VSCode has features for it preinstalled usually, but if you don't have it installed get it here.

### Python

For Python we will be using PyLint for keeping things neat and following the Python Foundation styleguide (automatically enforced by PyLint). You can install it with ``pip install pylint``. You should also make sure you install the Python language pack for VSCode. If you use a different IDE just Google "python [language]".

### C / C++ / Rust

For C-based languages we will use the Google Style guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>. For Rust we will use the Mozilla style guide <https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs>. Below is a list of quirks we need to be aware of for the platforms involved.

#### Raspberry Pi

For C and C++ we will be using GCC and the rest of the GNU C toolchain because it is by far the easiest to use.

#### Microcontrollers

For all of our microcontrollers (Arduino or otherwise) we will try and use C++ where possible. Bear in mind that you usually can't use the standard library which effectively transforms C++ into C with classes. Rust is more efficient but embedded support is not nearly as sophisticated just yet - it is *significantly* faster and more expressive than C/C++ however so it is superior.

#### PC / Mac / Linux

We probably will have to use CMake for this unless we can agree on sticking to a platform. We can also use Rust (again probably better for Signal Processing especially) - but this is subject to the skills of the team.
